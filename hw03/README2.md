#### *Tales From East to West*

A little over a year and a half ago I moved across the country
from West Chester, PA to Seattle, WA with my then boyfriend,
now husband because of a job transfer he was offered.

We currently live in Issaquah with our dog, Winston.

Winston is a rescue dog who is *really* cute, but a huge...
**trouble maker**.

In college, I studied Kinesiology.  I spent some time working in the field
then moved onto a grantmaking foundation supporting women and girls.

When we moved to Seattle, I got a job working for the
[Technology Alliance](http://www.technology-alliance.com).

I have always been interested in computer science and wanted to makea career change.  I figured now was as good a time as any.

I find data science and machine learning fascinating and hope to
make a career out of programming.  One day, I also hope to inspire other young girls/women to pursue a career in STEM.
