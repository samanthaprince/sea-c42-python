Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

sample_1:
    GC-content: 0.43059987061138255
sample_2:
    GC-content: 0.4514286106147601
sample_3:
    GC-content: 0.646867173111056
sample_4:
    GC-content: 0.3478539791909817
sample_5:
    GC-content: 0.26666666666666666
sample_6:
    GC-content: 0.4917006298629122

Problem 3:

When you run the program you receive an NameError that states name 'linenum' is 
not defined.  This happens because you define the current line number of DNA 
is being read on line 34 in the code.  When you comment out this line, and try to 
call linenum on line 38 in the code, it has not been declared or assigned a value yet.
Commenting out seq”” removes the place for the nucleotides that have been read to go.

When commenting out gc_count = 0, a similar event happens.  Running the code produces
a NameError and states that gc_count is undefined.  You must first define a variable
to use it.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.43059987061138255
AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 5:

G-content: 0.21269891276127206
C-content: 0.21790095785011046
A-content: 0.28543651609194487
T-content: 0.28396361329667263

Problem 6:

In all files, the metrics for the sum of a+t+c+g differed from the total count 
and the length of the sequence.  These differ because we only count the total number 
of the nucleotides ’A’, ’T’, ‘C’, ‘G’.  The DNA files also contained ’N’ to allow 
for human interpretation of the base.  The ’N’ count is included in the total count
and the length of sequence while it was not included in the sum of ATCG.  As expected
the length of sequence and the total count were always the same.

The sum of ATCG could successfully be used in the denmoniator because it does not include the 
’N’ count.  You could also use (total_count - n_count) in the denominator to as well.  The only 
flaw that would occur with using (total_count - n_count) would be if the computer threw something
other than ATCG or N in the sequence.

My program originally incorrectly calculated the the ATCG content because it was dividing by the
total count.   

Problem 7:

AT/GC ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

The organism is considered “moderate GC content”

Collaboration:

I did not collaborate with anyone.  I reviewed overall logical concepts with my husband
but he has no experience with programming and was just a sounding board for 
logical thinking.

Reflection:

I learned that I should start my homework earlier than I will think I need to.

I also learned that when using large amounts of data, you should always do a ‘sanity check’
to ensure that there aren’t errors in your data.  The errors can come from human input 
or the computer, but either way it is important to make sense of your results.

Part of the homework that I struggled with was getting the diff checker to work.  

I would let future students know that you should always ask questions.  I would also encourage
other students to comment their code to make sure you know what each piece does. It was
also helpful to test different pieces by commenting out small sections and testing small
pieces.
